			<h1> <br><span id="name">EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES</span></h1>
			<h2> Emerging technologies are technologies whose development, practical applications, or both are still largely unrealized, such that they are figuratively emerging into prominence from a background of nonexistence or obscurity. These technologies are generally new but also include older technologies.</h2>

		<h1>Artificial intelligence (AI)</h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>
			Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits
traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
Artificial intelligence is widely used to provide personalised recommendations to people, based for example
on their previous searches and purchases or other online behaviour. AI is hugely important in commerce:
optimising products, planning inventory, logistics etc. The term was found and invented by John McCarthy

Who is also called “the father of AI”. AI drives down the time taken to perform a task. It enables multi-
tasking and eases the workload for existing resources. AI enables the execution of hitherto complex tasks

without significant cost outlays. AI operates 24x7 without interruption or breaks and has no downtime.</p>

        <h1>3D printing </h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>
			3D printing is an additive process whereby layers of material are built up to create a 3D part. This is
the opposite of subtractive manufacturing processes, where a final design is cut from a larger block
of material. As a result, 3D printing creates less material wastage3D printing can cost anywhere from
$3 up to thousands of dollars. It's hard to get the exact cost of a 3D print without a 3D model.
Factors such as material, model complexity, and labor affect the price of 3D printing. 3D printing
services can sometimes cost more than an entry level 3D printer.As a 3D printing technician, you will
typically need a bachelor's degree. The three most established types of 3D printers for plastics parts
are stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), and fused deposition modeling (FDM). Out
of all the raw materials for 3D printing in use today, plastic is the most common. Plastic is one of
the most diverse materials for 3D-printed toys and household fixtures.</p>

         <h1>Voice or speaker recognition </h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>
			Voice or speaker recognition is the ability of a machine or program to receive and interpret
dictation or to understand and carry out spoken commands. Voice recognition has gained
prominence and use with the rise of AI and intelligent assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's
Siri and Microsoft's Cortana.Making hands-free calls to specific people in a contact list is
another example of voice recognition. Voice Biometrics: User verification is another example of
voice recognition in use.Voice recognition enables consumers to multitask by speaking directly to
their Google Home, Amazon Alexa or other voice recognition technology. By using machine
learning and sophisticated algorithms, voice recognition technology can quickly turn your spoken
work into written text.</p>
